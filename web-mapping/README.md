# Reflection Analysis

## In this lab, I tried to make a map that showed the numbers of confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in each province in China. 

##As I am still exploring the web-mapping, I have not include a case density map (#case/#total population), which better reflect geospatial pattern of severity in this outbreak.

##This map is designed for my family and friends who live in China at the moment. At the beginning of the outbreak, I worried so much about my family who live in Guangdong Province, which was the epic center of SARS 17 years ago.
##To raise their awareness, I spent most of my spare time collecting and screening information from reliable sources, and send many articles from various news outlets and other information I received from my local friends to them. That was before the lockdown of Wuhan City.
##It was when I first decided to map a real-time coronavirus map, that have a less biased color scheme and hope to better represent the severity ot the outbreak so that people can get more unbiased information and take appropriate action to protect themselves.

##I chose a dark background color and highlighted the situation in China, as my audience is my family and friends. The color of red was chosen as it is often linked to either alert or emergency. The hue of color reflect the level severity (number of confirmed cases).
##The name of each province are lable in the map and the number of confirmed cases is shown once the user hove on to a province of their interest.

##As I mentioned above, this is my debut web map that marks as the beginning of my web mapping adventure. There are spaces for improvement. For example, I want to incoporate another mode to view the case data. Specifically, users can click on a "density of epidemic" tab to see one in how many people in this area are diagnosed with COVID-19.
