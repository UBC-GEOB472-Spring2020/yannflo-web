# Lab 2 Florence's 2019 Journey

## https://ubc-geob472-spring2020.github.io/yannflo-web/lab2/my2019journey.html

### This map can be added to my own e-portfolio as an illustration of my 2019 co-op and global seminar experiences. It provides readers with a wikipedia link that they can go to, and allow the readers to have an idea of the basic geography of each city/country that I visited last year. The map will zoom in to the city once users click on the city name in the sidebar. When user click on the mapmarker, the map will be centered on the mapmarker. 

### It is a very simple map and so many improvement can be made. For example, a slider can be added to this map to represent timeline of the journey and a hyperlink can be added to the wikipedia link. Alternative map style can be added for user to choose. A subset of specific locations, tourist spots I have been can be added.
