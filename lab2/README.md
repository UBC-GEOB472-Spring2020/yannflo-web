# Lab 2 Florence's 2019 Journey

### This map can be added to my own e-portfolio as an illustration of my 2019 co-op and global seminar experiences. It provides readers with a wikipedia link that they can go to, and allow the readers to have an idea of the basic geography of each city/country that I visited last year. The map will zoom in to the city once users click on the city name in the sidebar. There is also a style selector in the top left corner that allow user to pick a style to read the map.

### To create this map, I first built my own geojson data that include city names, locations, wikipedia page links, date of travel(it was not shown in this map). Following the store locator tutorial on mapbox's website, I creatd a city list, then added an interactive function so that when city name in the sidebar is clicked, the map will zoom into the city with a specific zoom level that I already set up. User can therefore get a sense of the size and structure of these cities that I have been to. Lastly, I added a style switch for better visualization. 

### It is a very simple map and so many improvement can be made. For example, a slider can be added to this map to represent timeline of the journey and a hyperlink can be added to the wikipedia link. A subset of specific locations, tourist spots I have been can be added.
